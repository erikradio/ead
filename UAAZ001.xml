	 <head>Biographical Note</head> 
	 <p>Alexander Grayson Bowman, born in New York in 1838, came West as a young
		man. He lived in several different states, including Colorado, until he moved
		to California in 1859 and joined the Union efforts in the California Volunteer
		Army, Company B, 5th Regiment Infantry. Under the command of Colonel James
		Henry Carleton, Corporal Bowman served as a pace counter in the march of the
		"California Column," a strategic effort organized to gain control of the
		Confederate-captured New Mexico territory (present-day Arizona, New Mexico, and
		parts of Colorado and Nevada) and to prevent the capture of California. During
		this expedition from southern California through Arizona, New Mexico and
		northwest Texas, Bowman kept a handwritten daily record of the march from his
		1861 mustering in at Camp Union, California, until his mustering out at
		Franklin, near El Paso, Texas, as well as during his subsequent journey back to
		California, lasting until early 1865.</p> 
	 <p> Soon after arriving back in California, Bowman returned to Colorado to
		start a business with his brother, William R. Bowman. Eventually, the Bowman
		brothers settled in Farmington, New Mexico, where they established The Bowman
		Brothers drugstore in 1878, the community's first pharmacy.</p>
