<head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Richmond Jones, Jr. (1833-1861) was a mining engineer hired by Welcome
B. Sayles (1812-1862) of the Sopori Land and Mining Company and the Arizona
Land and Mining Company of Providence Rhode Island to survey the Sopori Rancho
boundary in the Arizona Territory. Both the Sopori Land and Mining Company and
the Arizona Land and Mining Company were incorporated in Providence Rhode
Island in 1859 by Sayles with firearms manufacturer Samuel Colt (1814-1862) as
a major stockholder. Although the Sopori Company was financed mainly out of
Providence, Cincinnati financiers Charles Debrille Poston (1825-1902) and
Samuel Peter Heintzleman (1805-1880) founders of the Sonora Exploration and
Mining Company, were also involved. Jones' diaries help to tie together the
sometimes complicated interactions of the companies. When the Civil War began
in 1861 United States troops were withdrawn from the territory of Arizona and
many mines closed due to increased raiding by Apaches. As the attacks increased
Jones diary entries become less frequent until they cease altogether in July
1861 when Jones was killed in an Apache raid while attempting to return to
Tucson Arizona. </p>
