	 <head>Biographical Note</head>
	 <p>Jesse Udall was born on June 24, 1893 in Eagar, Arizona, one of six
		children of Mormon settlers David King Udall and Ida Hunt. He attended
		elementary and high schools in St. Johns, Hunt, and Snowflake, Arizona, and
		graduated in 1914 from Gila Academy (now Eastern Arizona Junior College) in
		Thatcher, Arizona. In 1917 he wed Lela Lee (1895-1976). They had six
		children.</p> 
	 <p>Following service as an Army ambulance driver in France during World War
		I, Udall graduated from the University of Arizona Law School in 1924, and
		established a private practice in Safford. A Republican, he was elected County
		Attorney for Graham County, a position he held in 1925 and 1926. Returning to
		private practice, he served as a state legislator from Graham County from 1931
		to 1935. He was elected Graham County Superior Court Judge in November
		1938.</p>
	 <p>In 1926 and 1927, Udall helped organize a National Guard unit, 158th
		Infantry Company G, in Safford. He became captain of the unit in 1928, and five
		years later was promoted to major in the Judge Advocate Department. As
		Lieutenant Colonel in 1942 he was called to active duty in Washington, D. C.,
		where he served as Chief of the Review Section of the Internal Security
		Division, and later as a member of the Industrial Employment Review Board.
		Returning to Safford in 1945, Udall resumed his private law practice. He was a
		member of the Arizona Interstate Stream Commission from 1948 to 1953, and was
		appointed Graham County Superior Court Judge from 1953 to 1958. He served the
		Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in the presidency of it's Southern
		California Mission from 1958 to 1960. He resigned that position when he was
		appointed to fill the Arizona Supreme Court seat vacated by the death of Levi
		Udall. He was elected to that seat in 1960, 1964 and 1970, and retired in 1972
		due to the poor health of his wife Lela. He served as Chief Justice in 1964 and
		1969.</p>
	 <p>Udall married Lillian Cliff Jenkins in 1977. Throughout his life he was
		active in the Mormon Church, serving as bishop of Thatcher Ward, president of
		St. Joseph Stake, and patriarch of Tempe Stake. He was also active in a number
		of service organizations, including the Boy Scouts and Rotary Club. He died of
		heart failure on May 11, 1980.</p>

	 <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
	 <p>This collection is organized into two series: Personal and Family
		Papers; and Professional Papers. The Personal and Family Papers series includes
		biographical summaries; clippings documenting honors and personal and family
		achievements; a few miscellaneous church related items; retirement records and
		correspondence; certificates and awards from various civic organizations; and
		correspondence and clippings pertaining to son Addison Udall's World War II
		experiences. </p> 
	 <p>The Professional Papers series relates to his military and legal
		careers, and contains primarily correspondence, clippings, and speeches. Other
		miscellaneous documents include military orders, certificates, Arizona election
		results from 1960 to 1970, a list of opinions authored by Jesse Udall, and
		documents pertaining to the operation of the Arizona National Guard Unit in
		Safford between 1930 and 1940.</p>
	 <p>Most of the material in this series covers either the span of Udall's
		National Guard and subsequent Army involvement, 1930 to 1945, or his tenure on
		the Arizona State Supreme Court, 1960 to 1972. There is little relating to his
		legal career prior to 1960. Other events falling within the scope of this
		subgroup are his service on the Arizona Interstate Stream Commission and a
		post-retirement effort to persuade some U. S. Congressmen of the merits of
		purchasing a corridor through Mexico from Arizona to the Gulf of California.
		This collection contains none of the correspondence or papers generated by
		Udall in his capacity as lawyer or judge.</p>
