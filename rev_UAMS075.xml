      	<p>Three recording books containing livestock branding records and accounts of the operation and maintenance of the ranch in Otero, Colfax County, New Mexico. Some may

      		and sales. Also includes cash ledgers for Delano and Dwyer, and itemized accounts by name and duties of individual employees. Volume two, inscribed "Uña de Gato 
      	Book" on the cover, records totals of cattle on hand, branded and sold for the beginning of each year from January 1, 1886 - January 1, 1891. Volume three is a tally book of 
      	brands noted by location or outfit, for May through July, 1887. Front endpaper says "Delano &amp; Dwyer Round up Outfit."</p>
