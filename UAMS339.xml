  <scopecontent id="a3" encodinganalog="520"> 
	 <head>Scope and Content Note</head> 
	 <p>Topics referred to in these broadsides include invasions by Spain,
		France and the United States of America; mobilization for wars, including the
		Mexican American War; soldiers; elections; government positions; decretos
		(decrees); courts; prisoners; and financial issues, such as taxes, budgets, and
		customs. Often the broadsides in the individual state folders contain
		information from the federal government which the governor of the state
		released and signed. Some documents refer to the political conflicts between
		those who supported the Roman Catholic Church and those who advocated rigorous
		anti-clericalism. Also included are specific Plans, a 19th century aspect of
		Mexican political culture whereby a military or political leader would publish
		a Plan, usually named after where it was issued, and wait to see how many other
		political and military leaders would support it.</p>
