	 <p>George Miller (b. 1922) has been active in Tucson's Democratic Party
		politics since the 1970s. He was elected to the city council on a liberal to
		libertarian platform in 1977, a position which he occupied until 1991. In 1991
		he was elected Tucson's mayor. He served two terms as mayor of Tucson, retiring from public office in 1999. Geroge Miller has the disction of as Tucson"s longest serving public official, serving twenty-two consecutive years in office.</p> 
	 <p>Miller graduated from the University of Arizona and taught social
		studies at Tucson's Amphitheater High School from 1948 to 1951. He also served
		in World War II. After his teaching stint, Miller devoted himself to the
		development of his own paint contracting business (G. and M. Painting
		Contractors) before entering politics. Miller has long been identified with
		liberal perspectives, having been investigated by the House Un-American
		Activities subcommittee in 1954 (he refused to answer their questions about his
		membership in the communist party), and having served as one of the chief
		proponents in southern Arizona of George McGovern's 1972 presidential bid.</p>
