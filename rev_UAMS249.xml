	 <head>Historical Note</head> 
  	<p>Transformed by the arrival of the railroad in 1880, Albuquerque had a population of 8,000 by 1900.  The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway located a major maintenance and administrative facility in the town.  A new railroad station complex, including the Alvarado Hotel operated by Fred Harvey, was completed in 1902.  Also, in 1902, the Sisters of Charity built the town’s first tuberculosis hospital in response to the influx of increasing numbers of health seekers drawn by New Mexico’s climate.  The photographer appears to have resided in Albuquerque at least between 1899 and 1902, and may have been a Santa Fe Railroad employee.</p>
