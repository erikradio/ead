         <head>Scope and Content Note</head> 
      	<p>One volume of handwritten lecture notes dated October 30, 1771, addressed to medical students: the introductory sentence reads, "Gentlemen, I come here to deliver a 
      	course of Lectures on the Practice of Physic upon that part of our studies for which all the others are intended..." The entire text is written in one clear hand. The 
      	basic framework is a description of each disease and its symptoms, apparently a recounting of Cullen's earlier published work on the subject, Methodical Nosology, 1769. 
      	Following each description is a discussion of the medical treatment for that disease. Interspersed throughout are observations of specific patients, reports and opinions of
      	colleagues, and Cullen's conclusions regarding etiology.</p>
      	<p>One prominent recurring watermark depicts a figure holding a staff, with "Pro Patria" as the banner, beside a lion.</p>
      	<p>Pages 236-238 are blank, and the following leaf is missing, as is the cover.</p>
