	 <head>Historical Note</head>
	 <p>Tucson Tomorrow was organized in 1980, and incorporated in 1982. Its
		membership included a broad base of public officials, business and neighborhood
		leaders, and private citizens in the community. The purpose of the body was to
		identify and analyze existing or potential problems affecting the economic and
		social interests of the area, to develop solutions to those problems, and to
		educate the private and/or public sector about those problems.</p> 
	 <p>Identifying areas in need of study, Tucson Tomorrow established
		committees to facilitate the study process in nine areas: Arts, Culture and
		Leisure Activities, Crime and Public Safety, Economy, Education and Training,
		Government, Health Care and Social Services, Natural Resources, Transportation,
		and Urban Design and Planning. Several reports were issued from these studies,
		and a community forum, "Development for Tomorrow," was held in 1985 to present
		current findings.</p>
	 <p>To assist Tucson Tomorrow and to measure the community's attitudes, a
		related group, Goals for Tucson, was formed in 1981 with its own committees to
		survey viewpoints and to find consensus with regards to the mission of Tucson
		Tomorrow. After issuing a final report, Goals for Tucson disbanded in 1983.</p>
	 <p>Tucson Tomorrow reorganized in 1986, hired an executive director, and
		continued to examine a broad array of community issues through workshops,
		seminars, task forces, and publications. In September 1988, the membership
		voted to disincorporate and to convert the organization into a citizens league.
		From 1988 until 1990, the league administered its last grant contracts for two
		committees. </p>
