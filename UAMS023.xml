      								Northwestern District, from Dr. Neuman, and dated 1911 to 1912. The first letter says that the purpose is to instruct them on 
      								medical matters supplementary to his book. Symptoms and treatments of diseases like respiratory illness, rickets, measles, scarlet 
      								fever, eye diseases, and fevers are discussed. Certain local living conditions are cited as contributing toward the illnesses. 
      								Three of the letters contain general diagnostic techniques for use with children. Colored pencil illustrations are included in
