	 <p>This collection is organized into four series:</p> 
	 <list> 
		<item>Series I: Official Documents and Correspondence, 1853-1938</item> 
		<item>Series II: Letters, Itineraries, and Photographs of Maximilian and
		  Carlota, 1847-1866</item>

  <scopecontent id="a3" encodinganalog="520"> 
	 <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
	 <p>Collection consists of documents, letters, and visual materials related
		to Emperor Maximilian, Empress Carlota, and the people associated with them in
		the European intervention in Mexico, 1861-1867. Printed holographic imperial
		appointments and awards are signed by Maximilian, from 1864 to 1866. Other
		documents include letters and papers of Maximilian, Carlota, President Benito
		Juarez, and physicians Alvisio Miskey and Francisco Archer. Diaries and memoirs
		by others relate personal insights about the court and the political
		revolutions of the time. A diary by Charles Whitehead, mine owner and Mexico
		City resident, spans the years 1853 to 1865; an undated memoir "Les derniers
		jours de contre guerilla au Mexique" is by Jules de Rafelis-Saint-Sauveur; and
		a mimeographed copy of "My recollections of Maximilian" was written by Maria de
		la Fere, ca. 1907.</p> 
	 <p>Printed documents include magazine and newspaper articles from Mexico,
		the U.S., and Europe, from 1867 to the centennial remembrance in 1967 of
		Maximilian's death. Broadsides, decrees by officials such as the interim
		Governor Rafael J. Garcia, campaign notices, and proclamations about the war
		encompass the period 1855-1867. An 1895 protest, signed by 126 students,
		concerns the traitor Leonard Marques being allowed to remain in Mexico. Among
		the visual materials are cartes-de-visite photographs, photographic postcards,
		and photogravure depictions of many civil and military individuals. Ephemera
		include color stills from the 1939 Warner Brothers movie "Juarez." Other items
		are drawings by H. D. Nichols from photographs, color prints of Mexican
		locations of historic interest, and a composite photo of the scene before
		Maximilian and two of his generals, Miguel Miramon and Tomas Mejia, were
		executed.</p>
	 <p>Collection is mostly in Spanish; some material is in French, German and
		English.</p>

				At seven this evening in combat between Escobedo's troops and those of the
				Emperor, there was a complete triumph for the Imperial Army. Escobedo and
				Trevino and various chiefs and officials were taken..."</p>
			 <p>The General in Chief of the 3rd Division to the inhabitants of
				Puebla:</p>
			 <p>"Fellow Citizens: After vacillating a thousand times, the enemy
				has finally resolved to come against the City. You all know that a serious
				illness kept me in my bed. But the nearness of the enemy renewed my enthusiasm
				and brought nearer to my mind the duties that bind me to you and to the
				National Government. You now have me at the head of the worthy and honorable
				soldiers whom I chance to command, and I am ready to inflict an exemplary
				punishment on the enemy and to sustain the cause of order and of society.
				Compatriots, do not doubt: the enemy will have to repent of its mad intention.
				The god of battles is with us. Your fellow citizen and friend, Manuel
				Noriega."</p>
			 <p>The General in Chief of the 3rd Division of Puebla to the troops
				under his command:</p>
			 <p>"Soldiers: Today the enemy has decided to test our valor and
				loyalty. I am counting on the loyalty and valor of the people of Puebla who
				have never allowed this heroic city to be attacked with impunity..."</p>

			 <p>Mars, God of Wars. New Bulletin; Political, Military and Police
				Paper. v. 1, no. 4. Defeat of the Rebels in the Interior. Toluca:</p>
			 <p>It is known that at a late date the rebel forces were making ready
				to leave that city for Morelia. Those who are close to Mexico have received
				orders to withdraw to Toluca in order to proceed also to Morelia. The 
			 <title render="italic">Mexican Times </title>said Sunday afternoon:
			 "On considering the map of Mexico and noting the position of the forces, we see
			 clearly that the liberal chiefs have formed plans very like those which General
			 Grant formed in order to defeat General Lee and take Richmond. We can say that
			 Queretaro is the Richmond of this campaign, and that Escobedo approaching with
			 his forces is the General Grant, while Corona in place of Sherman is little by
			 little cutting communication and intercepting the supplies of the Imperial Army
			 of Queretaro. The most blind of men can see what the plan of the liberals is,
			 but it will not succeed for two reasons. First, because the Emperor Maximilian
			 is a skilled leader with military experience and he will not divide his
			 numerous army, but will move on Escobedo or on Corona to defeat each on
			 separately. We do not believe that the liberals are anxious to take a chance
			 against the 20,000 well-disciplined soldiers of the Emperor, supported by 60
			 pieces of artillery."</p>
			 <p>
			 <title render="italic">The Union</title> said yesterday that a Don
			 Martin Estrada, and another person whose name they do not recall, have turned
			 with 500 well-armed men in favor of the Emperor. The same paper said that 100
			 armed men who belonged to the French Army and who were fighting in the ranks of
			 Riva Palacio have abandoned that standard and have presented themselves to the
			 Imperial Government.</p>
