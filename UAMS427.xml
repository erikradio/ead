<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Church Women United began on a national level in 1941 with the mission
to promote world peace and justice through community service projects including
the organization of programs, events, and annual celebrations. Since then the
organization has expanded to include more than 1,200 local and state branches.
Church Women United in Tucson (CWUT), created in the late 1940s, supports the
national organization's mission and goals through its work with the Tucson
community. </p>
<p>The CWUT organizes three annual celebration days for the Tucson area,
which are also celebrated on both a national and international level: the World
Day of Prayer in March, May Friendship Day in May, and World Community Day in
November. Various community service programs including: Migrant Ministry, Farm
Labor and Indian Ministry, Marana Health Clinic, Families for International
Friendship (FFIF), Tucson Ecumenical Council, Women in Community Service/ Job
Corps, Habitat for Humanity, Armory Park Low Income Housing, Tucson Centers for
Women and Children, Youth on their Own and the Healthy Arizona Initiative have
been created, initialized, or first brought to Tucson by the CWUT. </p>
