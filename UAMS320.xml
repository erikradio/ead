	 <head>Biographical Note</head>
	 <p>William Hancock, a native of Massachusetts, came west following the gold
		rush and settled near Sacramento, California. In 1864, he enlisted in the
		Seventh California Infantry and was sent to Fort Yuma. He transferred to the
		First Arizona Volunteers in 1865 and spent his enlistment at Camp McDowell in
		central Arizona. </p> 
	 <p>Hancock was mustered out of service in 1866 and became superintendent of
		the government farm at McDowell where he served until 1868. In August, 1869, he
		signed a contract to build a store and become post trader at Camp Reno in the
		Tonto Basin. In 1870 he moved to the hamlet of Phoenix where he set up another
		store. During the 1870s Hancock acted as the first sheriff of Maricopa County,
		Phoenix postmaster, Maricopa County district attorney, surveyor, and probate
		judge. He also served as an official of the Salt River Valley Town Association
		and the Phoenix Town Association.</p>
