      	<p>Letters and photographs. Original and typescript copies of personal letters from Anna Ownby to her husband, Bramble B. Ownby, from 1881-1888. They relate daily events
      	in Lordsburg, while he was away working on the railroad. There is also an 1881 letter from Bramble&apos;s brother J.R. Ownby to his father, and an 1884 letter from John 
      	Salkeld to &quot;Dear Children.&quot; A two-page typescript of a 1944 statement made by Bramble Ownby recounts his early years in New Mexico. Among the photographs are one of 
      	Anna in 1896, and others of unidentified family members; two of the earlier photos are tintypes. Images of historic buildings in Lordsburg include the railway depot, several 
      	different &quot;Ownby Houses,&quot; and the saloon in 1884. A printed social invitation to the Ownby&apos;s is for a dancing party at Clifton, Arizona in 1884.</p>
