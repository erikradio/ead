	 <head>Biographical Note</head>
	 <p>John Robert Carter was born November 18, 1890 in Petersburg, Indiana. In
		1913, he enlisted in the United States Army at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma. Carter was a
		member of the African-American Company C of the 25th Infantry, organized in
		1869, which was stationed at Oahu, Hawaii from 1913 to 1918. In 1918, the 25th
		was transferred to Arizona where its companies were divided among camps in
		Yuma, Ajo, and Nogales. After a brief stay in Yuma, Carter and Company C moved
		on to Camp Stephen D. Little in Nogales from 1919 to 1920. He served in Company
		C and southeastern Arizona for the remainder of his military career. Carter is
		identified on Company C muster rolls taken periodically at Camp Harry J. Jones
		in Douglas, Arizona and Fort Huachuca, Arizona from 1922 until his retirement
		in 1943. Carter died in January, 1949. He last known residence was Douglas,
		Arizona.</p>

	 <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
	 <p>Collection consists of the personal and professional papers of John
		Robert Carter. </p> 
	 <p>Military Records and newspaper clipping consist of muster rolls, a copy
		of the general orders for the 25th Infantry, and a single newspaper article on
		the military execution of thirteen African American soldiers in the early
		1940s. The muster rolls are photocopies of the rosters of Company C of the 25th
		Infantry from approximately 1914-1928 and 1931-1940. The copy of general orders
		is a 1920 facsimile of the document officially forming the 25th Infantry in
		1869. This was Carter's personal copy, issued to him at Camp Steven D. Little,
		Nogales, Arizona in 1920 and bearing his signature. The newspaper clipping
		describes the hanging of thirteen African-American soldiers of the 24th
		Infantry for mutiny at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas. Carter saved this
		article and may have known some of the condemned men, who were guarded by
		Company C during their trial.</p>
	 <p>The Correspondence folder consists of postcards written from relatives
		and friends to Carter from 1916-1926.</p>
	 <p>The Military Photographs are almost entirely of African-American
		soldiers, both in uniform and off duty. A few of the photographs have notes
		written on the back. The Non-Military Photographs are mostly of
		African-American civilians, including many women. Some of the photographs have
		notes written on the back.</p>
	 <p>
	 <title render="italic">The Sandbur</title> is a 1924 yearbook of Camp Harry
	 J. Jones, Douglas, Arizona, where Carter's Company C was posted at various
	 times. This book includes rosters, descriptions of activities at the Camp, and
	 many photographs.</p>
	 <p>Photographs and Postcards of Nogales, Arizona and Mexico are mostly of
		buildings, but some include people. None of the photographs or postcards are
		written upon. Postcards from Hawaii and the Philippines are on a variety of
		subjects. None of the postcards are written upon.</p>
	 <p>
	 <title render="italic">Scenes Taken in the Philippines, China, Japan, and
		On the Pacific</title> is a photograph book published in 1912. Captions
	 describe each photograph and Carter pasted a list of Hawaiian terms and their
	 English equivalents inside the back cover. </p>
