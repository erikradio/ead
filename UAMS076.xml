         <head>Scope and Content Note</head> 
      	<p>One volume of handwritten lecture notes dated October 30, 1771, addressed to medical students: the introductory sentence reads, &quot;Gentlemen, I come here to deliver a 
      	course of Lectures on the Practice of Physic upon that part of our studies for which all the others are intended...&quot; The entire text is written in one clear hand. The 
      	basic framework is a description of each disease and its symptoms, apparently a recounting of Cullen&apos;s earlier published work on the subject, Methodical Nosology, 1769. 
      	Following each description is a discussion of the medical treatment for that disease. Interspersed throughout are observations of specific patients, reports and opinions of
      	colleagues, and Cullen&apos;s conclusions regarding etiology.</p>
      	<p>One prominent recurring watermark depicts a figure holding a staff, with &quot;Pro Patria&quot; as the banner, beside a lion.</p>
      	<p>Pages 236-238 are blank, and the following leaf is missing, as is the cover.</p>
