	 <head>Biographical Note</head>
	 <p>Born on 1 September 1851 near Claverack in the Hudson Valley of New
		York, John Philip Clum attended Rutgers University, but dropped out of college
		for health reasons and came West. Arriving in Santa Fe in 1871, he soon became
		a government astronomical observer with the Signal Corps. From 1874 until 1877,
		Clum served as Apache agent on the San Carlos Indian Reservation in Arizona
		Territory.</p>
	 <p>He adeptly handled the Apache outbreaks from the reservation by asking
		the military to withdraw to a distance of five miles from the reservation. To
		limit confrontations between the Apaches and the nearby settlers, Clum helped
		the Indians to implement agricultural pursuits which would make them
		self-supporting. He also encouraged them to set up their own law enforcement
		and judicial systems. As a result of these practices, Clum succeeded in
		converting many of the Apaches to a more sedentary existence. It was his Apache
		police force which tracked and captured Geronimo in 1877. Clum soon became a
		victim of the political situation in Washington. The Indian Commissioner had
		given the Army permission to once again come onto the San Carlos Reservation.
		Discouraged by the government's indifferent and unfair treatment of his Indian
		charges, Clum protested to Washington, and resigned from the Service when his
		objections were ignored.</p>
	 <p>In 1877, Clum became editor of the 
	 <title render="italic">Tucson Citizen</title>. In 1886, after three years
	 as editor of the Citizen, Clum founded and became the first editor of the 
	 <title render="italic">Tombstone Epitaph</title>, having been attracted to
	 that town by news of the rich silver strike there. Besides publishing the 
	 <title render="italic">Tombstone Epitaph</title>, Clum was elected Mayor of
	 Tombstone and was appointed Postmaster from 1884-1886.</p>
	 <p>Clum went to work for the U.S. Postal Service in Washington, D.C. in the
		late 1880s, but in the early 1890s, he was out west again, serving as Postal
		Inspector in the western judicial district of Texas. On 5 March 1898, Clum was
		appointed Post Office Inspector for the Territory of Alaska and charged with
		the organization and extension of the postal service there. He retired from
		this post in 1908.</p>
	 <p>After his retirement, John P. Clum traveled a great deal. A fine
		speaker, he was employed by the Southern Pacific Railroad as a lecturer. Also,
		Clum began to write his memoirs, which, after his death, his son Woodworth
		completed. The resulting book, 
	 <title render="italic">Apache Agent</title>, was later made into the motion
	 picture, 
	 <title render="italic">Walk the Proud Land</title>, starring Audie Murphy.
	 </p>
	 <p>John P. Clum died of a heart attack 3 May 1932 at the age of 81.</p>
