      	<p>The mining town of Jesús María is located at the southeastern corner of the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. Licenciado José Rafael Revilla was governor of the state 
      	of Chihuahua in 1833; Licenciado V. Guerra was associated with the Civil Court of Chihuahua.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Note</head> 
      	<p>Five, single-leaf, holographic documents relating to the judicial district, the partido, of Jesús María; as well as to the ayuntamiento, the municipal corporation in charge 
      	of administrating the town. Two letters are written by Revilla to the president of the ayuntamiento of Jesús María. The first, which deals with the death and 
      	destruction caused by a severe storm, is signed Revilla, Chihuahua, June 25, 1833; the second is signed and dated July 2, 1833. The third letter is signed and dated Lic. V.
      	Guerra, July 5, 1842, and is addressed to the first justice of the peace of Jesús María. The other two documents are reports. One is from Ignacio Bencomo, the 
      	justice of the peace of Motachic [possibly San Rafael de Motachic] to the sub-prefect of the partido of Jesús María. He lists the week&apos;s events, which includes mention 
      	of Apaches; its date is March 31, 1844. The unsigned fifth document, of uncertain date, regards patriotic observances and the naming of patriotic junta at Jesús María.</p>
      	<p>Revilla&apos;s stationery has a large watermark of a star inside a shield design. Both of his letters have official ink-stamps, but with unclear lettering around the bird. 
      	Guerra&apos;s stationery also has a large shield for a watermark, but with an eagle on a castle inside, the name Guise. Testa below, and the date 1838.</p>

      	<p>The town of Jesús María is also represented in MS 169, which has mining records from 1832-1836.</p>
