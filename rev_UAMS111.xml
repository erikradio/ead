      	<p>Letters and photographs. Original and typescript copies of personal letters from Anna Ownby to her husband, Bramble B. Ownby, from 1881-1888. They relate daily events
      	in Lordsburg, while he was away working on the railroad. There is also an 1881 letter from Bramble's brother J.R. Ownby to his father, and an 1884 letter from John 
      	Salkeld to "Dear Children." A two-page typescript of a 1944 statement made by Bramble Ownby recounts his early years in New Mexico. Among the photographs are one of 
      	Anna in 1896, and others of unidentified family members; two of the earlier photos are tintypes. Images of historic buildings in Lordsburg include the railway depot, several 
      	different "Ownby Houses," and the saloon in 1884. A printed social invitation to the Ownby's is for a dancing party at Clifton, Arizona in 1884.</p>
