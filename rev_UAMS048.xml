      	Vancouver Barracks to Fort Yamhill, Oregon; some of these concern the Blockhouse on the Siletz Reservation. Unrelated Civil War material from 1862 consists of official 
      	correspondence, telegrams, and orders pertaining to the 14th U.S. Infantry, Army of the Potomac, stationed at Fort Trumbull, Conn., and in the field in Virginia.  
      	The majority are signed by Lorenzo Thomas, Adjutant General, Washington, D.C.</p>
