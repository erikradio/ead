	 <head>Biographical Note</head> 
	 <p>The Manning Family was instrumental in the agricultural and urban
		development of Tucson and southern California during the late-nineteenth
		century. The family owned huge tracts of rich agricultural land in Arizona,
		California, and Mexico, were successful real estate developers, were active in
		local and national politics, and played a significant role in the growth of
		transportation technology in Tucson. Most of the family's fame and fortune was
		due to Levi Howard Manning, a kind of "Howard Hughes" figure of the
		southwest.</p> 
	 <p>Levi Howard Manning (1864-1935) was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi
		in 1864. His father was a state senator and the family owned a successful
		plantation in Holly Springs. According to family legend, Levi arrived in Tucson
		with a scandal hot on his heels. In 1882, at the age of eighteen, Levi came
		home from college for spring vacation with a fraternity brother. There was a
		circus in town, and the two went, managing to free an elephant while there. The
		elephant subsequently ransacked the town. When Levi told his mother, she told
		Manning that he should leave town before his father found out about his
		escapade. Levi left town that day with a small amount of money from his mother
		and her best carriage horses. He arrived in Tucson in 1883 (some accounts say
		1884), penniless. Manning's enterprising nature soon led him from a job hauling
		buckets of water to working as a reporter for the Tucson newspapers the Star
		and the Citizen. A few years later, Manning turned to agriculture and mining.
		He married Cordelia (Gussie) Lovell O'Connell, a renowned beauty and member of
		an established Tucson family.</p> 
	 <p>The exact date of the rise of Manning's fortunes is unknown, but between
		his arrival in Tucson and his election as its 17th mayor, Manning managed to
		get involved in a variety of successful ventures. Manning and his business
		partners spent millions of dollars developing land in the Santa Cruz Valley,
		and built and equipped the Santa Rita Hotel. His involvement in the
		reorganization of Tucson Gas, Electric Light &amp; Power Co. paved the way for
		the installation of power for a street railway system. Additionally, Manning
		discovered Signal Hill in California, a site of rich oil deposits. Under
		President Cleveland, Manning served as Surveyor Governor of Arizona
		Territory.</p> 
	 <p>In 1906, Manning began his first venture into cattle farming with his
		purchase of what would become known as Scotch Farms, a 500 acre ranch between
		Tucson and the San Xavier Mission. Eight years later, in 1914, Manning bought
		the entire Canoa Land Grant, which at that time spanned west from the base of
		the Santa Rita Mountains across the Avra Valley (ca. 40,000 acres). After
		purchasing the ranch, Manning developed it into what was considered one of the
		finest cattle ranches in the southwest, running mostly Hereford cattle, but
		also breeding Arabian horses. In 1916, the southern half of the ranch was sold
		to the Intercontinental Rubber Company, which was at that time experimenting
		with the production of guayule as a wartime substitution for rubber. Manning
		later acquired land adjacent to the southern half of the Canoa, to create a
		ranch of nearly 100,000 acres, and began a scientific breeding program to
		improve the quality of his cattle.</p> 
	 <p>In 1921, Manning's son, Howell (1899-1966) assumed the daily operation
		of the ranch. Howell had attended Culver Military Academy and Dartmouth College
		before joining the army as a machine gunner during World War I. Howell, who
		later became known as "Big Howell," leased or sold large portions of the Canoa
		ranch, mainly to finance a farming and ranching operation in Guaymas, Mexico.
		Howell was known as a sportsman and frequently went on long ocean fishing
		expeditions in Mexico. In the mid-1920s, Howell married Margaret Ferguson, and
		had two sons, Howell Jr. (killed in a car accident in 1951) and Marklan. The
		marriage lasted approximately ten years, and in 1933 Howell married his second
		wife, Evelyn. In 1935 the couple had a daughter, Clare (known as "Jinx"). </p> 
	 <p>In 1949, the family home, Paseo Redondo, was sold to the Tucson Elks
		Lodge (Levi H. Manning had been a member of the Lodge). The Elks owned the
		property until 1979, when it was sold to a local real estate developer. The
		house, located in downtown Tucson, still stands.</p>

	 <head>Organization</head> 
	 <p>The photographs are arranged chronologically for the primary members of
		the family and extended family thereafter. Notations have been made for
		particular studios or photographers where applicable. Print materials are
		arranged chronologically for family members and followed by materials related
		to the properties. </p>

  <scopecontent id="a3" encodinganalog="520"> 
	 <head>Scope and Content Note</head> 
	 <p>The photographs in this collection primarily depict members of the
		family in formal and informal poses. There is little here that documents their
		activities as cattle farmers. A series of cynotypes from the early part of the
		20th century documents the family's vacations at their camp in the Rincon
		Mountains. A series of panoramic photographs of Gussie Manning and members of
		the Elks Lodge was probably taken in the 1930s, rather than twenty years
		earlier, as the notation on the back of the prints.</p>
