	 <head>Biographical Note</head> 
	 <p>The national student union movement marks its beginnings from a small
		debating society begun at the University of Cambridge, England, during the
		middle part of the 19th century. Along with a similar organization at Oxford,
		the student unions became important vehicles for future leadership roles in
		England. By the end of the 19th century student unions had begun to form in
		America. Today hundreds of American universities belong to the Association of
		College Unions.</p> 
	 <p>While the initial impetus for the formation of unions has changed from
		an elite student debate club to an organization serving the entire university
		community, its stated goals still reflect the historical origins of the student
		union association. The mission statement of The University of Arizona Student
		Memorial Union, for example, states that: "In all its processes, the union
		encourages self-directed activity, giving maximum opportunity for
		self-realization and for growth in individual, social competency and group
		effectiveness." The union's goal is the development of persons as well as
		intellects. Traditionally considered the "hearthstone" or "living room" of the
		campus, today's unions are gathering places of the college. The unions provide
		services and conveniences that members of the college community need in their
		daily lives and create an environment for getting to know and understand others
		through formal and informal associations. The unions serve as unifying forces
		that honor each individual and value diversity. The unions foster a sense of
		community that cultivates enduring loyalty to the college.</p> 
	 <p>The idea for a student recreation center was first proposed by the
		President Cloyd Heck Marvin in 1923. This initial effort was followed in 1938
		by a committee formed under the leadership of President Alfred Atkinson to
		raise money for a student union building. However this initiative stalled due
		to a lack of funding and the start of World War II. After nearly 28 years of
		planning, and $1.2 million in expenditures, The University of Arizona Student
		Memorial Union building was completed in 1951. The Student Memorial Union at
		the University of Arizona is so named because it is dedicated to the memory of
		soldiers who died during World War I and World War II. Numerous expansions have
		been added to the initial 1951 building. The facilities are being replaced as
		of 1999-2001.</p>
