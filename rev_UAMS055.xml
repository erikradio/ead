      	<p>Original typescript text of speech delivered in the United States Senate, April 17, 1900, with holograph additions and corrections, and printed insertions. The speech was 
      	intended to persuade the Senate to vote against Senate Resolution 53, which proclaimed the Philippine Islands as territory belonging to the United States, and provided 
      	that a government be imposed by the United States. Senator Hoar cites examples of the decision of the United States in the case of Cuba, and also instances of the treatment 
      	of Afro-American civil rights in that time. He gives an extensive account of the recent history in the Philippines, with emphasis on the role  of Emilio Aguinaldo as a 
      	leader. There are many quotes about and from Aguinaldo.</p>
      	<p>Inscribed to E. W. Doherty from Geo. F. Hoar inside front flyleaf.</p>
