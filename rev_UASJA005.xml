	 <head>Biographical Note</head> 
	 <p>Hyman Capin (nee Kapinski), was born in Ponevezh, Lithuania, in 1874. He
		was the son of a tailor and served as an apprentice to his father. In 1886, he
		and his family emigrated to Manchester, England, then one of the clothing
		capitals of the world. In 1892, when he was 18, Hyman emigrated to the United
		States. Seven years later, he became a United States citizen. Hyman Capin
		settled in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where some of the Capin family had
		preceded him. It was there he met Dora Loon and married her in 1896. He worked
		as a tailor for several years. In the early 1900s Dora became ill, and the
		doctor advised that they move west to a drier climate. In 1906, the Capin
		family, now numbering seven, moved to Tucson, Arizona. Here Hyman worked as a
		tailor and eventually operated a dry cleaning establishment.</p> 
	 <p>Troubles on the United States and Mexico border brought military troops
		into Texas and New Mexico. In 1913, the Capin family moved to El Paso, Texas,
		to take advantage of Hyman's expertise as a military tailor. He opened shop and
		began to make military uniforms. In 1916 Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New
		Mexico and President Woodrow Wilson sent General Pershing and his soldiers in
		pursuit. As Columbus increased in size, Hyman took advantage of the activity
		there. In 1918 he opened a branch tailoring and clothing store and placed his
		son-in-law, Harry Chernin, in charge. When General Pershing failed to capture
		Pancho Villa, the military units in Columbus were withdrawn.</p> 
	 <p>In 1919 the Capin family moved to Nogales, Arizona where there was
		another military camp. He and his prospering young family opened a tailoring
		business where he employed forty tailors. As exclusive tailor for Camp Stephen
		D. Little, Hyman Capin designed a basic uniform pattern that could be adjusted
		to fit all sizes. One hundred people were then employed by Capin to take care
		of handmade work.</p> 
	 <p>The Capins bought their first retail store, S. Leeker Dry Goods, in
		Nogales, Arizona in 1922, which was later renamed Capin's Department Store. In
		1924, they purchased a second store in Nogales called La Ville de Paris from
		Charles Dumazert. In 1925, Hyman Capin, three sons, and two sons-in-law
		purchased a retail location in El Paso, Texas, from Stolaroff Dry Goods. This
		became the Boston Store. In 1934, the family purchased I. Schwarz Department
		Store in Texarkana, Texas. Both of the Texas stores were closed in the 1930s
		during the Depression. Hyman Capin retired in 1931, and died four years later
		in Tucson.</p> 
	 <p>His family continued to manage the business affairs, and Capin's
		Department Stores incorporated in 1949, as the Capin Mercantile Corporation. In
		1960, Capin's expanded their retail business in Nogales, with an additional
		store, the Parisian. In 1967 they purchased Robinson's Hardware Store in
		Nogales, and in 1968 the family opened the Duty Free Warehouse. The duty free
		business was expanded in 1969 by opening another store in San Luis, Arizona. In
		1971 the Capin family continued their retail expansion by opening a Capin's
		store in Douglas, Arizona. They also built and opened the Americana Motor Hotel
		in Nogales. In 1973, another Parisian store opened in Douglas, and a new
		location was opened in Nogales called Capin's Annex. In 1975, a Capin's Annex
		was opened in Douglas as well.</p> 
	 <p>A major devaluation of the Mexican peso occurred in 1976 and the Capins
		expanded into other markets. In the late 1970s the Capins diversified by adding
		two stores in Phoenix, Arizona, one of which eventually became the Factory 2-U
		divisions. In 1982 another major peso devaluation negatively impacted border
		merchants. At this time, Factory 2-U was growing rapidly, with over thirty
		outlets throughout Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. To accommodate its
		expansion, a 220,000 square foot corporate office and distribution center was
		built in Nogales, at a cost of approximately 7 million dollars. In 1995, amidst
		another peso devaluation and the effects of NAFTA, the Capin Mercantile
		Corporation sold their Factory 2-U stores to Family Bargain Corporation for
		$1.8 million.</p>
