      	<p>R.A. Lewis entered store accounts in Notre Dame, Indiana, from January 1 to April 26, 1883. On May 1, he formed a partnership in Cincinnati, Ohio, with J.A. Lyons and T.E. 
      	Howard furnishing the capital. The purpose of the J.A. Lyons and Company mercantile firm was to conduct a grocery and domestic shipping business; the entries here document 
      	it for the next three months. They shipped goods, often by steamboat, to New Orleans, Galveston, Pittsburgh, New York, and Chicago. The Cincinnati accounts end on May 30; on 
      	June 1, business was being conducted in St. Louis, Missouri. The last entry is July 22, 1883.</p>

      	<p>Bound ledger used for several different purposes; the last third of the book is blank. The first 29 pages contain financial entries for the grocery business of J.A. Lyons 
      	and Company in 1883. Incoming payments are registered, as are outgoing payments for store rent, office supplies, and the clerk's salary. Prices and quantities for groceries 
      	bought and sold are given. The most common items are flour, sugar, wheat, corn, salt, silk, calico, dry apples, bacon, coffee, tea, codfish, and butter. Reference is made to the
      	loss of one of their shipments to Galveston, when the steamboat sank in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> 
      	<p>The rest of the ledger entries are from New Mexico, possibly associated with Antonio Lucero. Two short accounts from 1888, in Peralta, regard lambing, wine, and 
      	cash transactions. Two pages of an inspector's log follow,of sheep shipped "out of the territory." Earmarks are drawn. A more substantial section, 
      	from p.40 to p.69, is a tally of cattle slaughtered in Gallup and Bernallilo, New Mexico, possibly from 1898 to 1899. It gives the number of animals, brands and earmarks, 
      	as well as company names and addresses. Those from Arizona selling cattle for slaughter include J. Phelan, Fowler Brothers, Goldman and Company, Brigham and Hicks, M. 
      	Smith, Tom Hagen, William Christy, C.P. Mullen, Babbitt Brothers, Alker Company, W.A. Bolton, R.L. Mullen, and J. Norton.</p>
