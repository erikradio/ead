	 <head>Historical Note</head> 
  	<p>The USS Arizona (BB-39) was launched by the United States Navy on June 19, 1915 and later commissioned on October 17, 1916. The ship was the second and last ship of the Pennsylvania class of super dreadnought battleships and boasted a 608 foot long hull made of steel which at its maximum breath reached 97 feet. She remained in the United States during World War I and instead served as a gunnery training ship on Chesapeake Bay. Following the end of World War I, she departed for Britain. On December 12, 1918 the ship sailed from Portsmouth, England acting as escort for President Woodrow Wilson to the Paris Peace Conference in Brest, France. In early 1919 the US Navy sent the ship to the Mediterranean on a few months' cruise. In 1921 the ship was sent into the Pacific to join the United States Pacific Fleet. From 1929-1931, the ship was modernized and used for training exercises between the two World Wars. The USS Arizona was used as aid to survivors of the Long Beach, CA earthquake of 1933. By 1940, the ship was a part of the Pacific Fleet that was transferred from California to Pearl Harbor, HI to deter imperialist Japanese forces. It was while stationed here that the USS Arizona was bombed during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which resulted in the death of 1,177 officers and crewmen and the sinking of the ship. The wreckage of the ship is at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, dedicated on May 30, 1962, straddles the ship's hull.  </p>

	 			<unitdate type="inclusive">1916-1941</unitdate>
	 		</did> 
	 		<scopecontent><p>This subseries comprises the bulk of this series and is arranged numerically by accession number. Items within this subseries are described at the item level. Certain materials are duplicated in other series within the collection. Materials consist primarily of black and white photographs of varying size that document the interior and exterior of the ship, its armament and machinery, the USS Arizona and other US Navy battleships stationed at various ports, the ship and her crew engaging in training exercises on the ship and on base, the ship in dry dock at various ports, and other scenarios. Materials within this subseries also document the crew and individual sailors engaging in routine duties as well as personal activities while on ship leave. Materials of particular interest from this subseries document the 1933 Long Beach, California earthquake relief efforts, the ship sailing the Panama Canal, the Neptune's Court Ceremony, the 1934 filming of Here Comes the Navy featuring James Cagney and Gloria Stewart, various USS Arizona athletic teams, and the December 7, 1941 Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Undated materials are believed to date circa 1920-1941. Item titles contain a three digit accession number assigned by the University of Arizona Student Union upon donation of the item. This number consists of a tripartite system that consists of three parts that refer to the year of the item’s acquisition, the transaction number of that year, and the individual specimen number within that transaction. </p></scopecontent>
