      	<p>Unknown compiler, but possibly organized by a women's group in the Kansas City area. Some of the cartoons have hand-written names and dates at the bottom: Mary O'Neal, 
      	"Mary's neighbor, Mrs. Barnett", Isabel H., Rose Ehrenfeld, Linda Harvey, Catherine, Opal, and Miss Auerbach. Occasional local cartoons and news items suggest 
      	the area, and a few newspaper banners identify the Kansas City Times, Kansas City Journal-Post, and Lawrence [Kan.] Daily Journal-World.</p>
      	<p>Jay Norwood, "Ding" Darling, was a syndicated American cartoonist affiliated with the New York Tribune, and the Des Moines Register-Tribune. Albert T. Reid was a 
      	freelance cartoonist from Kansas; John T. McCutcheon was affiliated with the Chicago Tribune; Silvey Jackson Ray with the Kansas City Star; Daniel Robert Fitzpatrick with 
      	the St. Louis Post-Dispatch; Vaughn Shoemaker syndicated with the Herald-Tribune; and Robert Brown was a freelance cartoonist.</p>
