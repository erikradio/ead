			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Charles Reznikoff was an American poet, author, and founder of the Objectivist School
				of Poetry. He was born on August 31, 1894, in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were
				Russian Jewish immigrants who had fled Russia after the assassination of Alexander
				II.</p>
			<p>At the age of sixteen he spent a year studying journalism at Missouri State
				University; in 1912 he entered the law School of New York University and graduated
				in 1916. He practiced law briefly and entered officer training school in 1918 during
				World War I but never saw active duty.</p>
			<p>Reznikoff worked for a time for his family's business as a hat salesman. He then
				worked for a legal publishing house where he wrote summaries of court records for
				legal reference books. In 1918, he privately published his 1st book of poetry,
					<title render="italic">Rhythms</title>.</p>
			<p>From his teens, Reznikoff had been writing poetry, much of it influenced by the
				Imagists, and publishing it using a second-hand press, for which he set the type
				himself. Throughout his writing life, Reznikoff was always concerned to ensure that
				his work was published, even at his own expense.</p>
			<p>In the 1930s, he gained recognition as one of the principal proponents of
				Objectivism. He helped to establish the Objectivist Press which published three of
				his books including the Waters of Manhattan in 1930. Unfortunately most of his work
				had little commercial success and the majority of his writings continued to be
				self-published.</p>
			<p>The most comprehensive edition of Reznikoff's work is <title render="italic">Poems
					1918-1975: The Complete Poems of Charles Reznikoff</title>(Black Sparrow Press,
				1989). His other books of poetry include; <title render="italic"
				>Holocaust</title>(1975) and <title render="italic">Testimony</title>, which are his
				most celebrated works, as well as <title render="italic">Going To and Fro and
					Walking Up and Down</title>(1941), <title render="italic">Jerusalem the
					Golden</title>(1934), <title render="italic">Poems</title> (1920), and <title
					render="italic">Rhythms (1918)</title>.</p>
			<p>In 1971, he was awarded the Morton Dauwen Zabel Prize by The National Institute of
				Arts and Letters. Later that same year, he also found a new publisher, Black Sparrow
				Press. In the years following his death Black Sparrow brought all his major poetry
				and prose works back into print.</p>
			<p>Apart from his brief venture in the south and a year spent as a Hollywood
				screenwriter in the 1930, Reznikoff was a lifelong resident of New York City. He
				died on January 22, 1976.</p>
