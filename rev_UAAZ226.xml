			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Born September 3, 1876 in Tucson, Arizona, to Edward Nye Fish, a merchant and
				landowner, and Maria Wakefield Fish, a teacher, Fish was the first student to
				matriculate (enter) at the University of Arizona in 1891, where she later became a
				founding member of the University’s alumni association in 1897, the only woman in
				the graduating class of 3. Before attending the University of Arizona, Fish attended
				Mills College in Oakland, California, until health problems compelled her to return
				to Tucson. At the University of Arizona, Fish studied mining (one of only two
				majors, alongside agriculture. Although she did not graduate with the first UA
				class, she eventually graduated with a B.S. in 1897. She began teaching as a
				substitute in Tucson area public schools before becoming the principal of the
				Congress Street School. In 1903, she became a teacher at Northern Arizona Normal
				School in Flagstaff (now Northern Arizona University). In 1905 she returned to
				Tucson to take care of her mother. That same year she married Frederick Carlyle
				Roberts, a civil engineer. In 1917 she became the first woman elected to the Tucson
				School Board. She served a three-year term, and was president of the board for two
				of those years. She also fought for Old Main when University President Dr. Alfred
				Atkinson wanted to destroy it. Fish was also active in many Tucson area
				organizations including Daughters of the American Revolution, the League of Women
				Voters, the Tucson Women’s Club, the American Association of University Women, and
				the Arizona Pioneers’ Historical Society. In 1959 she moved to Sherman, Texas, where
				she died on October 26, 1965 at the age of 89.</p>
