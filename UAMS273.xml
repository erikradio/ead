	 <abstract label="Abstract:">This collection contains one series, correspondence. It is
		comprised of 57 letters, 34 of which were written by George Cranston, primarily
		to his sister, Gertrude. 14 of these letters relate Cranston's experiences as a
		soldier in the Arizona Territory, from 1866 to 1870. Cranston was stationed at
		Fort Yuma, Camp Lowell, Fort Grant, Camp Tubac and Camp Crittenden, and his
		letters reveal the privations of a soldier's life, the uncertainties of living
		on the frontier, and the fear of Indian attacks. Leaving the army and Arizona
		in 1870, the letters continue with Cranston's travels in New Mexico, Kansas and
		Texas. The remaining letters, the bulk of which are addressed to Gertrude, are
		correspondence from other Cranston siblings, and letters from James Cranston,
		their father. Many of these are accounts of family activities and events,
		others reveal some of the emotional undercurrents in family life.</abstract>

	 <head>Biographical Note</head>
	 <p>George Cranston was born in 1848, probably in New York state. Following
		an argument with his father, George was ordered to leave the family farm, and
		in 1866 he joined the army. Cranston's first post was Fort Yuma, Arizona
		Territory. In the ensuing years, Cranston was stationed at a number of sites in
		southern Arizona, until 1870 when he left the army's service.</p> 
	 <p>Cranston went on to become a cowboy, farmer, rancher, and saloon keeper,
		trying his luck in Kansas, Texas, and finally Deming, New Mexico. The last
		letter, written in 1883, is the birth announcement of Cranston's second child
		written from Deming. It is unknown what became of George Cranston following
		1883.</p>

	 <p>This collection contains one series, correspondence. It is comprised of
		57 letters, 34 of which were written by George Cranston, primarily to his
		sister, Gertrude. 14 of these letters relate Cranston's experiences as a
		soldier in the Arizona Territory, from 1866 to 1870. Cranston was stationed at

		their father. Many of these are accounts of family activities and events,
		others reveal some of the emotional undercurrents in family life. </p> 
	 <p>Included are letters from Gertrude's fiancee, Brunson Dunning. Finally,
		there are a few letters in which the connection with the Cranston family cannot
		be determined.</p>
	 <p>Also included is a typescript of a short biography of George Cranston
		and a summary of many of the letters.</p>

		  <p>The first folder contains a summary of the information content of
			 George Cranston's letters, along with a biographical sketch, written by Douglas
			 Calhoun, a New York state book dealer. The following two folders contain the 34
			 letters from George Cranston, the bulk of which were written to his sister in
			 the East. It is these letters that provide some illustration of frontier
			 life.</p>
		  <p>The remaining correspondence contain letters primarily from family
			 members to Gertrude, and are accounts of relatives, friends and family events.
			 Also included is a collection of letters written by Gertrude's fiancee, Brunson
			 Dunning, a letter from George Cranston's fellow soldier and friend, Myron
			 Annis, and a few letters written by P. Morton. It is uncertain as to whom this
			 latter correspondence is addressed, and what Morton's connection is with the
			 Cranston family.</p>
