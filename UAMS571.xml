      	<p>This collection pertains to materials donated by Bill Bowers, who helped to save one of two bells from the battleship U.S.S. <title render="italic">Arizona</title> from being destroyed.</p>
      	<p>In 1944, while serving as an Army captain at the Puget Sound Naval Yard in Bremerton, Washington, Bowers came across the bell in a wooden crate while looking for something 
      	to signal gunmen with. Bowers learned that the bell was going to be melted down at the yard. He called to then University of Arizona President Alfred Atkinson requesting he call 
      	Arizona&apos;s then Governor Sidney P. Osborn save the bell, made from silver and copper mined in Arizona, from being destroyed.</p>
      	<p>The bell was delivered to The University of Arizona in 1946. Surprised by the large scale of the bell, a committee placed the bell in the Arizona State Museum until a suitable, 
      	safe home could be secured. In 1951, the bell was placed in the clock tower of the new Student Union. Although it could be heard ringing after sports victories against out-of-state 
      	teams, it was enclosed and could not be seen in the old Union&apos;s tower. In its new home, the bell is visible to all and rings monthly to honor outstanding achievement among 
      	students, faculty and staff at The University of Arizona.</p>
