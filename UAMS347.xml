	 <head>Biographical Note</head> 
	 <p>Russell Lee was born in Ottawa, Illinois on 21 July 1903. His childhood,
		although of comfortable middle-class rural American heritage, was marred by
		tragedy. His parents were divorced in 1908, when Lee was five, and his mother
		was killed in an accident in 1913. Lee was then passed between various
		relatives and guardians until he returned to Ottawa to be raised by family
		friends. He became interested in photography in 1931 while married to his first
		wife, artist Doris Emmrick. She introduced him to art, which he then took up
		seriously. Dissatisfied with his artistic accomplishments, however, Lee bought
		himself a camera and began taking pictures. During the early 1930s he took
		photographs of the destitute and homeless, and of the artistic community in
		Woodstock, New York, where he lived.</p> 
	 <p>Lee pioneered the "photo essay" approach to photography, producing
		photographic documentaries. In 1936, he joined Roy Stryker's Resettlement
		Administration Project, which became the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in
		1937. The Project's directive was to use photography to create a social
		awareness of America's rural problems during the depression years. During this
		time he traveled away from home for up to nine months at a time, photographing
		and documenting rural America. He and Doris Emmrick were amicably divorced, and
		Lee later married Jean Smith, who became his partner.</p> 
	 <p>On behalf of the FSA, Lee traveled to Texas, New Mexico, California, and
		Arizona. His most famous portrayals are of people pursuing their everyday lives
		in San Augustine, Texas (1939) and Pie Town, New Mexico (1940). He was a
		pioneer in the use of flash for indoor photography, capturing indoor images as
		well as the more usual outdoor scenes.</p> 
	 <p>During World War II, Lee photographed airstrips for the U.S. Air
		Transport Command in the Far East, but did not remain in the service once the
		war ended. He spent some time documenting the living and working conditions of
		coal miners for the Interior Department between 1946 and 1947, and then took on
		industrial assignments. In 1965, Lee began a new career as an educator in the
		Department of Art at the University of Texas at Austin. He died on 28 August
		1986 in Texas.</p>

	 <head>Scope and Content Note</head> 
	 <p>The majority of the photographs in this collection were taken at a time
		when Russell Lee was actively photographing for the FSA. The photographs in
		this collection cover three projects in Arizona that are typical of those
		supported by the FSA. They include both indoor and outdoor prints, and portray
		the goals of FSA to capture everyday reality. The projects are: Agua Fria
		Migratory Farm Workers Camp; the Arizona Part-Time Farms, Chandler Unit,
		Maricopa County; and Casa Grande Valley Farms, Pinal County. All of the Lee
		photographs are dated 1940, with the exception of a print not belonging to the
		above sets, from Cairns General Hospital, and dated 1942; the Albee prints are
		dated 1942, the Lange print, 1938, and the unattributed print is also dated
		1942. </p> 
	 <p>There are 17 prints in the Agua Fria Migratory Farm Workers Camp set, of
		varying sizes. They cover official displays of the camp itself to more detailed
		pictures illustrating aspects of life in the camp, including everyday chores,
		health facilities, school lunch, and recreational activities.</p> 
	 <p>The Arizona Part-Time Farms, Chandler Unit set has 3 prints. They
		include two scenes of a building, and one portrait of a member of the unit.</p>
	 
	 <p>The Casa Grande set is the largest of the three, comprised of 46 prints
		of varying sizes. The first prints cover the industry of the farm-dairy cattle
		and hog farming-and these are followed by prints of the camp, children in
		school, camp officials, examples of a house and other buildings, including the
		library.</p> 
	 <p>The collection is arranged according to size in two boxes, and within
		each box according to set. The four prints taken by other photographers are
		grouped together in one folder.</p> 
	 <p>A detailed list of the photographs in this collection is available in
		the paper copy of this guide at the University of Arizona Special Collections
		Reading Room.</p>
