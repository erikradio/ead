      	<p>Two holographic manuscripts of one-act plays that Collier adapted from short stories. The Old Women was adapted from The Needle by André de Lorde, and 
      	The Mask was adapted from Behind the Mask by H. M. Harwood and Tennyson Jesse. The first play is set in 1900, and is about three bitter elderly women in a 
      	French insane asylum. The second, which takes place in a Nevada cabin, concerns a man whose face has been destroyed. A "Horror Tonight" program is 
      	autographed by the entire cast. Also present are newspaper clippings about the performances and the theater, as well as a playbill.</p>
      	<p>These two plays were performed in Los Angeles at the Belasco Theatre in June and July, 1943; they were part of a program entitled "Horror Tonight: Masterpieces of the 
      	Macabre."</p>
