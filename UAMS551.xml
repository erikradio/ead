      	<p>Robert Broder began his photography career as a member of the Tucson High School Camera Club in 1956, submitting numerous photographs to the school’s newspaper and various local publications. Between 1957-1973, he was staff photographer for the University of Arizona Photographic Department. The photographs he created in this position document student life, faculty, campus buildings, events-including a visit by Robert Kennedy in 1968, athletic competitions, and views of the campus. In 1962, while still in this position at the University of Arizona, he worked as staff photographer for the Hughes Aircraft Company in Tucson, AZ where he developed an expertise in industrial photography. In 1966, he accepted a part time staff photographer position at the <title render="italic">Tucson Daily Citizen</title> and also worked as a string photographer for various local newspapers and publications including the Arizona Republic. The photographs he created during this period document people and various events that occurred in the Tucson, Phoenix, and southern Arizona region. As an assignment for the Arizona Republic, he photographed the 1968 production of <title render="italic">Lonesome Cowboys</title>, a film directed by Andy Warhol that was shot at Old Tucson Studios. These photographs were later exhibited at a show in 2001 at the Etherton Gallery in Tucson, AZ and published in a corresponding book edited by Eric Kroll titled Warhol: Dylan to Duchamp (these materials are not held within this collection). In 1973, he was an instructor at the Winona School of Photography located in Winona Lake, Indiana. Beginning in 1980 he worked as a freelance photographer specializing in wedding and stock photography. </p> <p>Throughout his career, Broder received several local and national photography awards and had his works exhibited in local, national, and international exhibits.</p>
