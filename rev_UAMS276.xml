	 <head>Biographical Note</head> 
	 <p>Jean Baptiste Salpointe was born at St. Maurice, Puy de Dome, France on
		February 21, 1825. After studying theology at Clermont Seminary, he was
		ordained as a priest. He held several posts in Europe before arriving in the
		United States as a missionary for Archbishop Lamy of Santa Fe. Salpointe was
		sent to the Arizona Territory, and when this region was converted to a
		vicariate, Salpoint was named the First Vicar Apostolic of Arizona, his
		territory including Arizona, New Mexico and a part of Texas. He was again
		promoted in 1884, this time to archbishop, succeeding Lamy. He resigned this
		position in 1894, returning to Tucson, where he died four years later.</p>

	 <head>Scope and Content Note</head> 
	 <p>This collection consists largely of photocopies of translations in
		English of letters in the Archives of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson. The
		original letters written in French are in the Archive of the Society for the
		Propagation of the Faith, in Lyons, France. Numbers in the upper right hand
		corner of the transcripts reflect classification in that archive. The originals
		were photocopied in France by a Tucson priest and translated by Marcel G.
		Langlois. The bulk of the material contained in Folder 1 are letters and
		progress reports from Bishop Salpointe written to the Society for the
		Propagation of the Faith, relating the financial outlook of the Vicariate
		Apostolic of Arizona and progress with churches, schools and missions. There
		are a few letters from Salpointe to others, and some letters received by
		Salpointe. Additionally, there are a few letters that are neither from or to
		Salpointe, but discuss Salpointe or the Vicariate. One letter of interest
		received by Bishop Salpointe was from Charles Ewing, Catholic Commissioner for
		Indian Missions, dated July 2, 1874, assuring the Bishop that his request for
		the removal of R.A. Wilbur, Indian Agent to the Papagos had been completed. In
		Folder 2, there are also photocopies of holographic translated excerpts from
		some of the letters and reports found in Folder 1, that discuss the Indians in
		the region and progress by the Catholic Church in conversion efforts amongst
		the Indians.</p>
