			<p>The mining town of Jesús María is located at the southeastern corner of the state of
				Chihuahua, Mexico. Licenciado José Rafael Revilla was governor of the state of
				Chihuahua in 1833; Licenciado V. Guerra was associated with the Civil Court of
				Chihuahua.</p>

			<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
			<p>Five, single-leaf, holographic documents relating to the judicial district, the
				partido, of Jesús María; as well as to the ayuntamiento, the municipal corporation
				in charge of administrating the town. Two letters are written by Revilla to the
				president of the ayuntamiento of Jesús María. The first, which deals with the death
				and destruction caused by a severe storm, is signed Revilla, Chihuahua, June 25,
				1833; the second is signed and dated July 2, 1833. The third letter is signed and
				dated Lic. V. Guerra, July 5, 1842, and is addressed to the first justice of the
				peace of Jesús María. The other two documents are reports. One is from Ignacio
				Bencomo, the justice of the peace of Motachic [possibly San Rafael de Motachic] to
				the sub-prefect of the partido of Jesús María. He lists the week's events, which
				includes mention of Apaches; its date is March 31, 1844. The unsigned fifth
				document, of uncertain date, regards patriotic observances and the naming of
				patriotic junta at Jesús María.</p>
			<p>Revilla's stationery has a large watermark of a star inside a shield design. Both of
				his letters have official ink-stamps, but with unclear lettering around the bird.
				Guerra's stationery also has a large shield for a watermark, but with an eagle on a
				castle inside, the name Guise. Testa below, and the date 1838.</p>
